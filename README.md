Overview
========

This project contains a simple example of a read-only implicit weighted graph built using the [Boost Graph Library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_43_0/libs/graph/doc/table_of_contents.html "Boost Graph Library"). It can be used as a starting point for developers creating their own implicit graphs.

The example consists of a single program called _implicit_ which creates a simple graph, prints information about it, then uses it in a Dijkstra search.

Building
========

You must have the Boost Graph Library installed.  Set the BOOST_PATH in the Makefile to point to the root of your Boost include tree.
